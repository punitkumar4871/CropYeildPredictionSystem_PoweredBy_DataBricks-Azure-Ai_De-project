## 🔁 Pipeline Breakdown

1. **🔗 Data Ingestion:**

   * Raw agricultural data is dynamically fetched from GitHub using automated pipelines.

2. **🧱 Medallion Architecture:**

   * **Bronze Layer:** Stores raw data.
   * **Silver Layer:** Data cleaned, enriched, and transformed using Spark.
   * **Gold Layer:** Aggregated and analytics-ready for reporting.

3. **📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

   * Insights are derived to guide model design and feature engineering.

4. **🤖 ML Model Training:**

   * Trained on Silver Layer data for accurate crop yield predictions.

5. **🌐 Model Deployment:**

   * ML model deployed as a real-time web application with user input and output interface.

6. **📈 BI Dashboard:**

   * Interactive dashboard created from Gold Layer to visualize trends and aid decision-making for stakeholders.
