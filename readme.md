this is my MLOPs deployment project.

This End-to-End Crop Yield Prediction System is a cloud-based solution that utilizes Databricks, Big Data tools, and Machine Learning to accurately forecast agricultural crop yields. The system begins by dynamically fetching raw agricultural data from GitHub through an automated pipeline. Using the Medallion Architecture, the data is processed in three structured layers â€” Bronze (raw), Silver (cleaned and enriched), and Gold (analytics-ready). Transformations and preprocessing are carried out in Databricks using Apache Spark on the Bronze layer to produce clean datasets in the Silver layer. Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to uncover insights and guide feature selection. A machine learning model is then trained on the Silver layer data to predict crop yields, followed by the deployment of the model as a web application for real-time predictions. Finally, a Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard is created using the Gold layer to provide stakeholders with clear, interactive visual insights into crop performance and trends, completing the full data-to-decision pipeline.

the projects look like this :
